# Blockly Maze Completion:
## After you complete the 10th level, what is the JavaScript code you got? Cut and paste and assign it to the variable level_10_code.       How many blocks did you have left? Assign it to the variable remaining_blocks.
```
# Cut and paste the JavaScript code and assign it 
# to the variable below 
level_10_code = "while(notDone()){moveForward();if(isPathForward()){if(isPathRight()){turnRight();}else{if(isPathLeft()){turnLeft();}}}else{if (isPathLeft()){turnLeft();}else{turnRight();}}}"
# Transfer the value from Level 10 "blocks remaining"
# to the variable below 
remaining_blocks = 0 
print("JavaScript code for Level 10")
print(level_10_code)
print("Number of blocks remaining", remaining_blocks)
```
